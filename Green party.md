The Greens have won 15% of the vote in the federal election. The environmentalist party will likely be part of the next government, but their dream of taking the chancellorship is over for now.

cons: 
* The Greens were never a big-tent party in terms of their program, their members and their electorate, The Greens' core electorate still tends to be young, urban and educated, Oskar Niedermayer says. "It differs significantly in its social composition from the population as a whole, and that just has its limits quantitatively.

* According to Niedermayer, the party leadership consisting of Baerbock and her co-chairperson Robert Habeck has moved the Greens from the left further to the center of the party landscape. As a result, in early summer they were able to win voters beyond their core constituency. "But only for a relatively short period of time. And when the chancellor candidate made serious mistakes at the beginning of the election campaign, these voters immediately jumped ship."

And the Greens' major issue — climate protection — was at the top of the agenda in the election campaign since the disastrous floods in western Germany in mid-July, at the latest.

pros: 
* We achieved significantly more positive gains [for the Green Party] in the flooded areas than in the non-flooded areas."
* two out of three Germans said that climate protection was one of the most important tasks for the new government. Simultaneously, the Greens were repeatedly credited with the greatest competence in finding solutions for environmental and climate protection. 

Change is scary:
Changes are wanted by the electorate, but they also cause fear. For me, that's also human."
