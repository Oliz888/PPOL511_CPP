Merz (opposition leader; leader of the center right CDU) and Scholz (center left-SPD) 
* Merz:  "None of us wants to go back to the old nuclear energy, which we ended in Germany in 2011," "But the economics minister's decision to [keep two of those nuclear plants](https://www.dw.com/en/germany-to-extend-last-2-nuclear-power-plant-lifespans-by-a-few-weeks/a-63023953) only in reserve was a big mistake" 

Scholz: Germany rapidly weaning itself off Russian energy 
* He said Germany had worked effectively to shift its energy supplies away from Russia, by stockpiling gas, and expediting the [construction of gas terminals](https://www.dw.com/en/liquefied-natural-gas-controversial-terminals-european-green-deal-climate-change-lng/a-52377555). The gas reserves — currently over 86% capacity — will be used to heat homes, generate electricity and power industry.
* "We have spoken with our friends on the west European coast, with the Netherlands and Belgium for them to expand (LNG) terminals and pipeline capacities with France which will for the first time deliver gas to us."

Amira Mohamed Ali (Left party paliamentary group leade): accused the coalition of neglecting the needs of many people across the company. demanded that leaders return to the negotiating table with Russia to "ensure the security" of gas supplies. 

## [Pressure mounts on Germany’s Scholz to send tanks to Ukraine](https://www.politico.eu/article/german-government-faces-domestic-pressure-to-send-tanks-to-ukraine/) (2022,09,22)

Germany was only “number 18 in the world” when comparing its military aid for Ukraine relative to the economic output. 
(CDU/CSU) opposition block had requested a vote on a Bundestag motion that urges the government to “immediately” allow the export of German battle tanks and infantry fighting vehicles to Ukraine. That would have been tantamount to a vote of no-confidence in Scholz’s Ukraine strategy, since the chancellor has repeatedly ruled out such deliveries as long as other Western allies don’t deliver similar heavy gear. 

* the Greens and the liberal Free Democratic Party (FDP), have also demanded the delivery of German Leopard battle tanks and Marder infantry fighting vehicles. A vote on weapons deliveries in the Bundestag would have risked revealing fatal cracks in the government unity and could even have led to a defeat of Scholz in parliament.

* Senior lawmakers from the Greens and FDP expressed clear disapproval of the chancellor’s position and stressed that they want Germany to send more heavy arms. 

Greens’ co-leader Omid Nouripour delivered a broadside against concerns among Social Democrats that the delivery of tanks to Ukraine could trigger an “irrational” escalation by Putin

Military assistance to Kyiv has become something of a litmus test of Olaf Scholz’s ability to lead Europe through its most significant security crisis since World War II 

Berlin's sequel movement on the aid of Ukraine: 
* won widespread applause when he announced a [rearmament program](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/27/world/europe/germany-ukraine-russia.html?searchResultPosition=6) worth around $100 billion and overturned a ban on arms exports to conflict zones, breaking with decades of German pacifism. 
* hen his government offered Ukraine 5,000 helmets and a field hospital.
* it took months and the threat of a parliamentary vote before he approved any shipments of heavy weapons.
* Berlin has pledged over 700 million euros’ worth of military aid, or about $678 million, to Ukraine, including a modern air defense system. 
* It has also sent multiple rocket launchers, sophisticated artillery and dozens of antiaircraft guns, which contributed to Ukraine’s stunning recent advance on the battlefield!

Waiting for U.S. or other allies to take first movement? 
* the U.S. Embassy in Berlin posted on Twitter what many interpreted as a veiled invitation to Germany: “We call on all allies and partners to lend as much support as possible to Ukraine in its struggle for democratic sovereignty 
* All of Europe is waiting for Germany to make the first step,” said Marie-Agnes Strack-Zimmermann, a member of the Free Democrats, one of the three parties in Mr. Scholz’s coalition government, and the head of the parliamentary defense committee.  
*  caution was also evident during the interview in his reluctance to detail his own vision for how the war might end, preferring instead to cite a guest essay by President Biden that The Times published in May. 

For a chancellor with a robotic manner that long ago earned him the nickname “Scholz-o-mat,” there were moments during the sometimes tense interview with The Times when Mr. Scholz was surprisingly emotional when reacting to questions that challenged him

The condemnation came shortly after German Chancellor Olaf Scholz announced the [introduction](https://www.politico.eu/article/germany-set-to-introduce-gas-price-cap/) of a gas price cap to serve as a "large defensive umbrella" to shield households and companies from increasing gas prices. The price tag: €200 billion in fresh debt.

* Special funds create non-transparency. They obscure budgetary truth and clarity,"
* injecting fresh money into the economy via a special fund was different from regular debt, which can potentially increase inflation.
* Germany would not follow the U.K.’s example "down the path of an expansionary fiscal policy."

## [Germany's Greens reject nuclear plant extension beyond winter](https://www.dw.com/en/germanys-greens-reject-nuclear-plant-extension-beyond-winter/a-63264701) (2022,09,28)

Green: German Environment Minister Steffi Lembke said on Wednesday that the energy crisis meant it was "reasonable" to keep two nuclear plants running for three months beyond their planned closure, but that she rejected any further extension. 

Free Democrats (FDP):  who favor an indefinite extension to the usage of nuclear power in Germany amid the predicted energy supply shortage in winter.

In 2011, the German government decided to close all its nuclear plants by the end of 2022, partly in response to the nuclear accident that year in Fukushima, Japan. 

What did Lembke say? 
* "I think it is reasonable to keep these two nuclear power plants online for a few more months," Lembke! I rule out extending the running time beyond the coming winter and the necessary purchase of new fuel elements."  
* the final decision on whether to extend the plants' lifespan would be taken by the German parliament. 

Criticism from other parties
*  FDP, which has called for a third remaining plant, Emsland, also to remain online and for the plants to remain operational for several more years.
