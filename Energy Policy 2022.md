War in Europe. A pandemic. Climate change. Never before has a German government been forced to deal with such massive challenges from day one. Will the coalition break apart

FDP: the smallest is the most confident
* business oriented 
* finance minister (Lindner) and chancellor are getting on well 

Olaf Scholz:
* climate protection, digitalization and economic transformation. 
* like to work behind the scenes. practically disappeared from public view

Renewable 'freedom energies'instead of Russian gas 
* not to give the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline an operating license (agreed by Greens) 
* Greens: 1) not only geopolitical reason. 2) reducing the use of fossil fuels and accelerating the expansion of renewable energy sources. 
* opportunities for the Greens: soaring energy prices and risk of Russian turning off the gas 
* FDP: Christian Lindner labeled wind and solar power as "freedom energies", while also adovocate a roll-back of the nuclear phaseout.

Some in the three-way coalition with Scholz's left-leaning Social Democratic Party (SPD) also want him to do more to reduce German energy dependence on Russia. 
* "I am of the opinion that even a complete energy embargo is possible," said Hofreiter, who visited Ukraine this week with the SPD's Michael Roth and the FDP's Marie-Agnes Strack-Zimmermann

"The war in Ukraine puts an end to the German economic business model as we knew it — a model which was mainly based on cheap energy imports and industrial exports into an increasingly globalized world," he said." 
* Gas games: domestic household as well as industries (A survey of 3,500 companies recently carried out by Germany's Chambers of Industry and Commerce (DIHK) found that 16% were either scaling back production or partially discontinuing business operations due to rising energy prices) 
* potential recession: certain sectors within German industry are particularly energy-intensive. Chemicals sector is the most significant.

Greens Robert Habeck: "the situation is serious"
1. bring back online coal-fired power plants that had been drawn down to reduce carbon emissions (a measure to lower gas usage, gas storage tank must be full by winter) 
2. Russian imports of gas accounts for 55% of country's natural gas supply. after Moscow’s Feb. 24 invasion of Ukraine, Berlin began purchasing gas from Norway, the United States and the United Arab Emirates, reducing its purchases from Russia by about 20 percent. 
* insisted that Russian gas will be needed to ensure storage tanks are at least 90 percent full by November, 1/3 of households are heated with natural gas. 

# [Germany's north-south divide flares up over energy cirsis](https://www.dw.com/en/germanys-north-south-divide-flares-up-over-energy-crisis/a-62940864) (2022,08)
Germany's north-south political divide has turned unusually virulent in the past few weeks, with the state premiers of Bavaria in the south and Lower Saxony in the north trading acid remarks about energy resources. 
* Bavaria (large, rich and famous for picturesque scenary): free pride in state's old monarchy and nationhood. 
* Lower Saxony: from the North Sea coast to the borders of former East Germany

the leader of Bavaria's conservative CSU: Germany should consider fracking for shale gas reserves in Lower Saxony, which was banned nationwide as it's considerd one of the most environmentally damaging methods to obtaining energy. 

Robert Haberk: criticism of Bavarian policy - blaming Bavaria for Germany's potentil energy shortage this winter. 
* "southeastern region" failed to diversity its renewable energy resources and focus too much on solar energy. "The problem is that in Bavaria the sun doesn't shine at night either, and in Bavaria, the days are shorter in January too," 
* CSU General Secretary Martin Huber: "Habeck has no clue about Bavaria," claiming that Bavaria was a "pioneer" of renewable energy 

"The situation is that, with the loss of coal, and the new situation on the gas market, it's clear that Bavaria and Baden-Württemberg [the wealthy state in Germany's south-west] will have the biggest problems in the future, while the states on the coast, with more wind energy, have an advantage."

Germany's plan for its so-called "energy transition" was once fairly clear: To compensate the southern states for the loss of nuclear and coal power, Germany was to build more power lines linking northern and southern power grids.

# Election at stake
Lower Saxony will go to the polls on October 9, while Bavaria is gearing up for an election next autumn
* The latest polls in Lower Saxony give Stephan Weil's center-left Social Democrats SPD 30% of the vote and a narrow three-point lead over the conservative Christian Democratic Union (CDU) with 27%
*  CDU Weil, if a state pre,ier has been succesful, they are re-elected. 
*  Some liberalization in the CSU over the last few years make a coalition with the Greens possible. 
That, one imagines, would also make things easier for Habeck and the federal government, since it could provide the political foundation for a new renewable energy drive in Bavaria.

Conflicts have emerged in ruling coalition over financing the government's effort to stave off a collapse of Germany's energy sector
* Financial Minister Christian Linder (business-friendly): swipe at Habeck pay for the deal to nationalize gas giant Uniper SE. Legal issue related to a gas levy and nationlization of Uniper had been cleared up.

Levy on consumers: The disputed levy, due to take effect on Oct. 1, is designed to compensate utilities for soaring wholesale energy prices by charging consumers a fee of 2.419 cents per kilowatt hour. 
* the measure was originally criticized for being too loosely defined, allowing unaffected companies to apply for the funds. Habeck has sought to close loopholes to shut out “freeloaders.” 

* Matthias Miersch, a deputy leader of the parliamentary caucus for Scholz’s Social Democrats, seemed to back Habeck, saying the bailout means that “the legal doubts about a gas surcharge increase enormously. 

A failute of the levy could put pressure on Germany's budgets, and finance ministry is putting pressure on Habeck's economy 
* Habeck’s Greens would be in favor of raising taxes or taking on more debt to help finance the government’s response to the crisis, 
* but Lindner’s Liberals have ruled out these options.
* Despite the dispute over financing, the parties agree on the need to avert a collapse of Germany’s energy sector because of Russia’s moves to slash supplies.

# [German Government Nationalizes Uniper in Move to Secure Energy Supply](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/09/21/business/germany-uniper-nationalized.html) (2022,09)

Germany will spend 8 billion euros ($7.9 billion) to acquire shares in Uniper it does not already own, raising its stake to 99 percent, and inject an additional €8 billion in fresh capital into the company, the economy minister, Robert Habeck, said.
* Uniper, once Germany’s largest importer of Russian gas, is the second energy provider within a week that the German government has had to save by intervening to ensure supply, and the third company linked to fuel imports from Russia that has required government intervention since Russia invaded Ukraine

The internventions are part of a broad set of actions by governments across Europe, which are effectively reversing decades of promoting a free-market approach to the electricity and natural gas industries, as lawmakers move to secure supply in the face of record-high energy prices.
